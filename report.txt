1. preprocess
	a. clean useless information from tweets (i)
		involves a few things. majority of tweets have two numbers at the start, a tweet body and a date and time at the end. we want to just pull the body and get rid of the rest.

		Number of tweets: 3847
		# with date and time at end: 3738
		# with two numbers at start: 3744


discard small words?
get rid of words in tweet that arent locations??????

coudl tokenize but local edit distance as an alg focuses on substrings anyway. toeknizing would make more sense for global edit distance.
